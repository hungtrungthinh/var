<h1>Virtual Eyewear Try-on sample project</h1>
<p>
Virtual Eyewear Try-on sample uses the <a href="visar_api.html"><em>VisageAR</em></a> API to implement a simple augmented reality application for virtual try-on of eyeglasses.
</p>

<h2>Installing and running the project</h2>

<p>
The project must be installed on a web server in order to run (it can not run from a local disk). For a quick trial from Visage Technologies web server, click 
<a href="https://www.visagetechnologies.com/HTML5/Samples/VirtualEyewearTryOn/eyewear.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To install the application on your own web server, upload folders lib and Samples to your web server. To run the application access the Samples/FaceTracker/sampleTracker.html page via a web browser.
</p>
<p>
Application will give licensing warning and will be limited to one minute. To remove this limitation:  
<ol>
<li>Contact your Visage Technologies contact person in order to obtain a license key.</li>
<li>Copy the obtained license key file into your application folder (e.g. samples/VirtualEyewearTryOn).</li>
<li>Edit lib/visageAR.js. Uncomment the line Module.initializeLicenseManager("...") and replace the "xxx...xxx.vlc" with the name of your license key file.
</ol> 
</p>

<h2>Using the sample application</h2>
<ul>
<li>Running the sample requires a recent browser (tested on Firefox 45 and Chrome 49).</li>
<li>The SDK needs to download its data files before using the application.</li>
<li>Allow the site to access your camera by choosing "Allow" in the browser's pop-up bar.</li>
<li>Look straight at the camera and glasses will appear.</li>
<p><img src="images/using_app.jpg" alt="Using the application" width="640"></p>
<li>Other glasses models are chosen using the choice bar.</li>
<li>Enter inter-pupillary distance in millimetres and press "Change IPD" to influence the tracker z axis translation and 
calibrate the size of the glasses, so they appear in real-life size with respect 
to your face.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<p>
Virtual Eyewear Try-on is implemented in HTML and JavaScript using the 
<a class="el" href="VisageAR.html" title="VisageAR...">VisageAR API</a> for rendering and face tracking. 
For information on preparing models for use with VisageAR see the <a href="doc/modeling_guide.pdf">AR modelling guide</a>.
