<h1>Gaze Tracker sample project</h1>
<p>
Gaze Tracker sample uses the <a href="index_api.html#visageVision-t"><em>VisageSDK</em></a> API to implement a simple application which demonstrates screen space gaze tracking.
</p>

<h2>Installing and running the project</h2>

<p>
The project must be installed on a web server in order to run (it can not run from a local disk). For a quick trial from Visage Technologies web server, click 
<a href="https://www.visagetechnologies.com/HTML5/beta/Samples/GazeTracker/gazeTracker.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To install the application on your own web server, upload folders lib and Samples to your web server. To run the application access the Samples/GazeTracker/gazeTracker.html page via a web browser.
</p>
<p>
Application will give licensing warning and will be limited to one minute. To remove this limitation:  
<ol>
<li>Contact your Visage Technologies contact person in order to obtain a license key.</li>
<li>Copy the obtained license key file into your application folder (e.g. Samples/GazeTracker).</li>
<li>Edit GazeTracker/GazeTracker.html. Uncomment the line Module.initializeLicenseManager("...") and replace the "xxx...xxx.vlc" with the name of your license key file.
</ol> 
</p>
<p>
For further information please read <a href="licensing.html" target="_blank">licensing</a> section of the documentation.

<h2>Using the sample application</h2>
<ul>
<li>Running the sample requires a recent browser (tested on Firefox 45 and Chrome 49).</li>
<li>The SDK needs to download its data files before using the application (you can track progress via progress bar).</li>
<li>Allow the application to access your camera by choosing "Allow" in the browser's pop-up bar.</li>
<li>Look straight at the camera. Tracking will start.</li>
<li>Once the tracker has initialized you can start calibration phase of screen space gaze estimation by clicking Calibrate button.</li>
<li>In the calibration phase, application displays a calibration point as a red dot moving around the screen. Follow the movement of the dot in order to calibrate the system.</li>
<li>After the calibration point stops moving, the gaze tracking system is calibrated and the estimation phase starts.</li>
<li>In the estimation phase, the application draws the estimated gaze location as a blue dot on screen.</li>
<li><i>Optional</i>: Change the tracker configuration using the drop down menu. For details regarding tracker configuration 
files, please refer to the <a href="doc/VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual</a>.
</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<p>
Gaze Tracker is implemented in HTML and JavaScript using the VisageSDK API for face tracking and screen space gaze estimation, and native canvas methods for rendering.
