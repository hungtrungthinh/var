 * Face data structure, used as container for all face tracking and detection results.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * This structure is passed as parameter of the {@link Tracker#track|Tracker.track()} or {@link Detector#detectFeatures|Detector.detectFeatures()} method.
 * The method copies latest tracking or detection results into it.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * When filling the structure with data some members are filled while some are left undefined depending on tracking/detection status. 
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 *
 * &lt;h5>Obtaining tracking data&lt;/h5>

 * The tracker returns these main classes of data:

 * &lt;li>3D head pose&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>facial expression&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>gaze direction&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>facial feature points&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>full 3D face model&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * &lt;br/>
 * The tracker status is returned as the return value of the {@link Tracker#track|Tracker.track()} function. 
 * The following table describes the possible states of the tracker, and lists active member variables (those that are filled with data) 
 * for each status.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>

 *
 * &lt;b>Smoothing&lt;/b>
 *
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The tracker can apply a smoothing filter to tracking results to reduce the inevitable tracking noise. Smoothing factors are adjusted separately for different parts of the face. 
 * The smoothing settings in the supplied tracker configurations are adjusted conservatively to avoid delay in tracking response, yet provide reasonable smoothing. 
 * For further details please see the smoothing_factors parameter array in the &lt;a href="doc/VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual&lt;/a>.

 * &lt;li>full 3D face model, textured&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * &lt;br/>
 * Detection result is returned from {@link Detector#detectFeatures|Detector.detectFeatures()} method.

 * &lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
 * &lt;/table>
 * &lt;br/>
 *
 * &lt;h5>Returned data&lt;/h5> 
 *
 * The following sections give an overview of main classes of data that may be returned in FaceData by the tracker or the detector, and pointers to specific data members.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;b>3D head pose&lt;/b>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The 3D head pose consists of head translation and rotation. It is available as absolute pose of the head with respect to the camera.
 * &lt;br/>
 * The following member variables return the head pose:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFaceTranslation|faceTranslation}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFaceRotation|faceRotation}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * Both Tracker and Detector return the 3D head pose.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;b>Facial expression&lt;/b>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Facial expression is available in a form of Action Units.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Action Units (AUs) are the internal representation of facial motion used by the tracker. It is therefore more accurate to use the AUs directly.
 * It should be noted that AUs are &lt;a href="doc/VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">fully configurable&lt;/a> in the tracker configuration files (specifically, in the 3D model file, .wfm).
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The following member variables return Action Units data:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#actionUnitCount|actionUnitCount}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getActionUnitsUsed|actionUnitsUsed}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getActionUnits|actionUnits}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getActionUnitsNames|actionUnitsNames}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * Only Tracker returns the facial expression; Detector leaves these variables undefined.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;b>Gaze direction and eye closure&lt;/b>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Gaze direction is available in local coordinate system of the person's face or global coordinate system of the camera.
 * Eye closure is available as binary information (OPEN/CLOSED).
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The following member variables return gaze direction and eye closure:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getGazeDirection|gazeDirection}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getGazeDirectionGlobal|gazeDirectionGlobal}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getEyeClosure|eyeClosure}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * Only Tracker returns gaze direction and eye closure; Detector leaves these variables undefined. 
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;b>Facial feature points&lt;/b>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * 2D or 3D coordinates of facial feature points, as defined by the &lt;a href="doc/MPEG-4 FBA Overview.pdf">MPEG-4 FBA standard&lt;/a>, are available.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * 3D coordinates are available in global coordinate system or relative to the origin of the face (i.e. the point in the centre between the eyes in the input image).
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Facial features are available through the following member variables:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFeaturePoints3D|featurePoints3D}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFeaturePoints3DRelative|featurePoints3DRelative}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFeaturePoints2D|featurePoints2D}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * Both VisageTracker and VisageDetector return facial feature points.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;b>3D face model&lt;/b>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The 3D face model is fitted in 3D to the face in the current image/video frame. The model is a single textured 3D triangle mesh.
 * The texture of the model is the current image/video frame. 
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The 3D face model is fully configurable and can even be replaced by a custom model; it can also be disabled for performance reasons if not required. Please see the &lt;a href="doc/VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual&lt;/a> for further details. The default model is illustrated in the following image:
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * This means that, when the model is drawn using the correct perspective it exactly recreates the facial part of the image. 
 * The correct perspective is defined by {@link FaceData#cameraFocus|camera focal length}, 
 * width and height of the input image or the video frame, model {@link FaceData#getFaceRotation|rotation} and {@link FaceData#getFaceTranslation|translation}. 
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * There are multiple potential uses for the face model. Some ideas include, but are not limited to:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>Draw textured model to achieve face paint or mask effect.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Draw the 3D face model into the Z buffer to achieve correct occlusion of virtual objects by the head in AR applications.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Use texture coordinates to cut out the face from the image.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Draw the 3D face model from a different perspective than the one in the actual video.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>Insert the 3D face model into another video or 3D scene.&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Note that the vertices of the face model may not always exactly correspond to the facial feature points obtained from tracking/detection (featurePoints3D). 
 * For applications where the precise positioning of the facial feature points is recommended (e.g. virtual make-up), it is important to use the featurePoints3D and not the face model.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * The 3D face model is contained in the following members:
 * &lt;br/>
 * &lt;ul>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#faceModelVertexCount|faceModelVertexCount}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFaceModelVertices|faceModelVertices}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#faceModelTriangleCount|faceModelTriangleCount}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFaceModelTriangles|faceModelTriangles}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;li>{@link FaceData#getFaceModelTextureCoords|faceModelTextureCoords}&lt;/li>
 * &lt;/ul>
 * Both Tracker and Detector return the 3D face model, if the mesh_fitting_model parameter in the configuration file is set (see 
 * &lt;a href="doc/VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual&lt;/a> for details).
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;h6>Screen space gaze position&lt;/h6>
 * Screen space gaze position is available if the tracker was provided with calibration repository and screen space gaze estimator is working in real time mode. 
 * Otherwise tracker returns default screen space gaze data. Default gaze position is centre of screen. Default estimator state is off (ScreenSpaceGazeData.inState == 0). Please refer to {@link VisageGazeTracker} 
 * documentation for instructions on usage of screen space gaze estimator.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Screen space gaze position is contained in member {@link FaceData#gazeData|gazeData}.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * Only face tracker returns screen space gaze position.
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
 * &lt;br/>&lt;br/>

	* corresponds to the real camera used, the returned coordinates shall be in meters; otherwise the scale is not known, 
	* but the relative values are still correct (i.e. moving towards the camera results in smaller values of z coordinate).
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* The feature points are identified
	* according to the MPEG-4 standard (with extension for additional points), so each feature point is identified by its group and index. For example, the tip of the chin
	* belongs to group 2 and its index is 1, so this point is identified as point 2.1. The identification of all feature points is
	* illustrated in the following image:
	* &lt;img src="images/mpeg-4_fba.png">
	* &lt;img src="images/half_profile_physical_2d.png">
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* Certain feature points, like the ones on the tongue and teeth, can not be reliably detected so they are not returned
	* and their coordinates are always set to zero. These points are:
	* 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6.
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* Several other points are estimated, rather than accurately detected, due to their specific locations. These points are:
	* 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 7.1, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.12, 9.13, 9.14, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 11.1,

	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* &lt;h4>Face contour - group 13 and group 15&lt;/h4>
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* Face contour is available in two versions: the visible contour (points 13.1 - 13.17) and the physical contour (points 15.1 - 15.17).
	* The physical contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running from one ear to another, following the outer edge of cheeks and the jaw. 
	* Depending on face rotation, points on the physical contour may not always be visible; however, our algorithm maps them on the 3D model of the face and estimates the invisible points. 
	* Therefore all points of the physical contour are always available, regardless of their visibility, in both 3D and 2D (featurePoints2D, featurePoints3D, featurePoints3DRelative). 
	* The 2D points are obtained by projection from the 3D points, and they may not correspond to the points on the visible contour.
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* The visible contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running along the edges of the visible part of the face in the image, starting at the height of ears. 
	* Thus, in a frontal face the visible contour runs from one ear, along the jaw and chin, to the other ear; in a semi-profile face it runs from the visible ear, along the jaw and chin, 
	* then along the cheek on the far side of the face; in full profile it runs from the ear, along the jaw, then up along the mouth and nose. The points on the visible contour are obtained 
	* directly by detection/tracking, and they are available only in 2D (featurePoints2D). Please note that point 13.17 is exactly identical to point 2.1 
	* (2.1 point exists for MPEG-4 compatibility purposes).
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* &lt;h4>Stability and accuracy of the contours&lt;/h4>
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
	* The points on the visible contour are among the most difficult to detect/track, and their accuracy is lower than that of eyes or mouth points; they are also more noisy (jittery). 
	* The points on the physical contour are obtained from the fitted 3D model of the face. This stabilises them so there is considerably less jitter. 
	* In general, it is recommended to use the physical contour.
	* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
